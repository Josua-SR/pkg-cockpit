  * Add smoke autopkgtest that can run in containers.
    Add a simple test of cockpit-bridge and the login page to ensure that
    packages have the right dependencies and contents, and that the systemd
    units are set up correctly to get a login page on
    https://localhost:9090.
    This can also run in a container and thus in Debian's CI and on all
    Ubuntu architectures.

cockpit (141-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix autopkgtest:
    - Latest avocado now requires python-libvirt, add it as test dependency.
    - Use the packaged phantomjs instead of phantomjs-prebuilt as that is only
      available for x86_64; this should make the tests work on other
      architectures too. The Debian/Ubuntu phantomjs package is built with Qt
      support, so run under $QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen to work in a headless
      test environment.
    - Drop stray "sudo" command. The test already runs as root, this was a
      copy&paste leftover.
