It will insert 'reboot' markers, for\n   example, and collapse repeated lines.  You can extend the output at\n   the bottom and also at the top.\n\n   A new renderer is created by calling 'journal.renderer' like\n   so:\n\n      var renderer = journal.renderer(funcs);\n\n   You can feed new entries into the renderer by calling various\n   methods on the returned object:\n\n      - renderer.append(journal_entry)\n      - renderer.append_flush()\n      - renderer.prepend(journal_entry)\n      - renderer.prepend_flush()\n\n   A 'journal_entry' is one element of the result array returned by a\n   call to 'Query' with the 'cockpit.journal_fields' as the fields to\n   return.\n\n   Calling 'append' will append the given entry to the end of the\n   output, naturally, and 'prepend' will prepend it to the start.\n\n   The output might lag behind what has been input via 'append' and\n   'prepend', and you need to call 'append_flush' and 'prepend_flush'\n   respectively to ensure that the output is up-to-date.  Flushing a\n   renderer does not introduce discontinuities into the output.  You\n   can continue to feed entries into the renderer after flushing and\n   repeated lines will be correctly collapsed across the flush, for\n   example.\n\n   The renderer will call methods of the 'output_funcs' object to\n   produce the desired output:\n\n      - output_funcs.append(rendered)\n      - output_funcs.remove_last()\n      - output_funcs.prepend(rendered)\n      - output_funcs.remove_first()\n\n   The 'rendered' argument is the return value of one of the rendering\n   functions described below.  The 'append' and 'prepend' methods\n   should add this element to the output, naturally, and 'remove_last'\n   and 'remove_first' should remove the indicated element.\n\n   If you never call 'prepend' on the renderer, 'output_func.prepend'\n   isn't called either.  If you never call 'renderer.prepend' after\n   'renderer.prepend_flush', then 'output_func.remove_first' will\n   never be called.  The same guarantees exist for the 'append' family\n   of functions.\n\n   The actual rendering is also done by calling methods on\n   'output_funcs':\n\n      - output_funcs.render_line(ident, prio, message, count, time, cursor)\n      - output_funcs.render_day_header(day)\n      - output_funcs.render_reboot_separator()\n\n*/\n\njournal.renderer = function renderer(funcs_or_box) {\n    var output_funcs;\n    if (funcs_or_box.render_line)\n        output_funcs = funcs_or_box;\n    else\n        output_funcs = output_funcs_for_box(funcs_or_box);\n\n    function copy_object(o) {\n        var c = { }; for (var p in o) c[p] = o[p]; return c;\n    }\n\n    // A 'entry' object describes a journal entry in formatted form.\n    // It has fields 'bootid', 'ident', 'prio', 'message', 'time',\n    // 'day', all of which are strings.\n\n    function format_entry(journal_entry) {\n        function pad(n) {\n            var str = n.toFixed();\n            if (str.length == 1)\n                str = '0' + str;\n            return str;\n        }\n\n        var d = new Date(journal_entry[\"__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP\"] / 1000);\n        return {\n            cursor: journal_entry[\"__CURSOR\"],\n            full: journal_entry,\n            day: month_names[d.getMonth()] + ' ' + d.getDate().toFixed() + ', ' + d.getFullYear().toFixed(),\n            time: pad(d.getHours()) + ':' + pad(d.getMinutes()),\n            bootid: journal_entry[\"_BOOT_ID\"],\n            ident: journal_entry[\"SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER\"] || journal_entry[\"_COMM\"],\n            prio: journal_entry[\"PRIORITY\"],\n            message: journal.printable(journal_entry[\"MESSAGE\"])\n        };\n    }\n\n    function entry_is_equal(a, b) {\n        return (a && b &&\n                a.day == b.day &&\n                a.bootid == b.bootid &&\n                a.ident == b.ident &&\n                a.prio == b.prio &&\n                a.message == b.message);\n    }\n\n    // A state object describes a line that should be eventually\n    // output.

For \"xy\", the selection becomes a rectangle where both ranges can be\nspecified. \"color\" is color of the selection (if you need to change the color\nlater on, you can get to it with plot.getOptions().selection.color). \"shape\"\nis the shape of the corners of the selection.\n\n\"minSize\" is the minimum size a selection can be in pixels. This value can\nbe customized to determine the smallest size a selection can be and still\nhave the selection rectangle be displayed. When customizing this value, the\nfact that it refers to pixels, not axis units must be taken into account.\nThus, for example, if there is a bar graph in time mode with BarWidth set to 1\nminute, setting \"minSize\" to 1 will not make the minimum selection size 1\nminute, but rather 1 pixel. Note also that setting \"minSize\" to 0 will prevent\n\"plotunselected\" events from being fired when the user clicks the mouse without\ndragging.\n\nWhen selection support is enabled, a \"plotselected\" event will be emitted on\nthe DOM element you passed into the plot function. The event handler gets a\nparameter with the ranges selected on the axes, like this:\n\n\tplaceholder.bind( \"plotselected\", function( event, ranges ) {\n\t\talert(\"You selected \" + ranges.xaxis.from + \" to \" + ranges.xaxis.to)\n\t\t// similar for yaxis - with multiple axes, the extra ones are in\n\t\t// x2axis, x3axis, ...\n\t});\n\nThe \"plotselected\" event is only fired when the user has finished making the\nselection. A \"plotselecting\" event is fired during the process with the same\nparameters as the \"plotselected\" event, in case you want to know what's\nhappening while it's happening,\n\nA \"plotunselected\" event with no arguments is emitted when the user clicks the\nmouse to remove the selection. As stated above, setting \"minSize\" to 0 will\ndestroy this behavior.\n\nThe plugin allso adds the following methods to the plot object:\n\n- setSelection( ranges, preventEvent )\n\n  Set the selection rectangle. The passed in ranges is on the same form as\n  returned in the \"plotselected\" event. If the selection mode is \"x\", you\n  should put in either an xaxis range, if the mode is \"y\" you need to put in\n  an yaxis range and both xaxis and yaxis if the selection mode is \"xy\", like\n  this:\n\n\tsetSelection({ xaxis: { from: 0, to: 10 }, yaxis: { from: 40, to: 60 } });\n\n  setSelection will trigger the \"plotselected\" event when called. If you don't\n  want that to happen, e.g. if you're inside a \"plotselected\" handler, pass\n  true as the second parameter. If you are using multiple axes, you can\n  specify the ranges on any of those, e.g. as x2axis/x3axis/... instead of\n  xaxis, the plugin picks the first one it sees.\n\n- clearSelection( preventEvent )\n\n  Clear the selection rectangle. Pass in true to avoid getting a\n  \"plotunselected\" event.\n\n- getSelection()\n\n  Returns the current selection in the same format as the \"plotselected\"\n  event. If there's currently no selection, the function returns null.\n\n*/\n\n(function ($) {\n    function init(plot) {\n        var selection = {\n                first: { x: -1, y: -1}, second: { x: -1, y: -1},\n                show: false,\n                active: false\n            };\n\n        // FIXME: The drag handling implemented here should be\n        // abstracted out, there's some similar code from a library in\n        // the navigation plugin, this should be massaged a bit to fit\n        // the Flot cases here better and reused.
