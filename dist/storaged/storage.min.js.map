Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nexports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\nvar Transition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

For \"xy\", the selection becomes a rectangle where both ranges can be\nspecified. \"color\" is color of the selection (if you need to change the color\nlater on, you can get to it with plot.getOptions().selection.color). \"shape\"\nis the shape of the corners of the selection.\n\n\"minSize\" is the minimum size a selection can be in pixels. This value can\nbe customized to determine the smallest size a selection can be and still\nhave the selection rectangle be displayed. When customizing this value, the\nfact that it refers to pixels, not axis units must be taken into account.\nThus, for example, if there is a bar graph in time mode with BarWidth set to 1\nminute, setting \"minSize\" to 1 will not make the minimum selection size 1\nminute, but rather 1 pixel. Note also that setting \"minSize\" to 0 will prevent\n\"plotunselected\" events from being fired when the user clicks the mouse without\ndragging.\n\nWhen selection support is enabled, a \"plotselected\" event will be emitted on\nthe DOM element you passed into the plot function. The event handler gets a\nparameter with the ranges selected on the axes, like this:\n\n\tplaceholder.bind( \"plotselected\", function( event, ranges ) {\n\t\talert(\"You selected \" + ranges.xaxis.from + \" to \" + ranges.xaxis.to)\n\t\t// similar for yaxis - with multiple axes, the extra ones are in\n\t\t// x2axis, x3axis, ...\n\t});\n\nThe \"plotselected\" event is only fired when the user has finished making the\nselection. A \"plotselecting\" event is fired during the process with the same\nparameters as the \"plotselected\" event, in case you want to know what's\nhappening while it's happening,\n\nA \"plotunselected\" event with no arguments is emitted when the user clicks the\nmouse to remove the selection. As stated above, setting \"minSize\" to 0 will\ndestroy this behavior.\n\nThe plugin allso adds the following methods to the plot object:\n\n- setSelection( ranges, preventEvent )\n\n  Set the selection rectangle. The passed in ranges is on the same form as\n  returned in the \"plotselected\" event. If the selection mode is \"x\", you\n  should put in either an xaxis range, if the mode is \"y\" you need to put in\n  an yaxis range and both xaxis and yaxis if the selection mode is \"xy\", like\n  this:\n\n\tsetSelection({ xaxis: { from: 0, to: 10 }, yaxis: { from: 40, to: 60 } });\n\n  setSelection will trigger the \"plotselected\" event when called. If you don't\n  want that to happen, e.g. if you're inside a \"plotselected\" handler, pass\n  true as the second parameter. If you are using multiple axes, you can\n  specify the ranges on any of those, e.g. as x2axis/x3axis/... instead of\n  xaxis, the plugin picks the first one it sees.\n\n- clearSelection( preventEvent )\n\n  Clear the selection rectangle. Pass in true to avoid getting a\n  \"plotunselected\" event.\n\n- getSelection()\n\n  Returns the current selection in the same format as the \"plotselected\"\n  event. If there's currently no selection, the function returns null.\n\n*/\n\n(function ($) {\n    function init(plot) {\n        var selection = {\n                first: { x: -1, y: -1}, second: { x: -1, y: -1},\n                show: false,\n                active: false\n            };\n\n        // FIXME: The drag handling implemented here should be\n        // abstracted out, there's some similar code from a library in\n        // the navigation plugin, this should be massaged a bit to fit\n        // the Flot cases here better and reused.

Later, when the user clicks on \"Ok\", the \"action\"\n   function will be called with the values of the dialog fields.  The\n   action function usually returns a promise, although it does not in\n   the example above.  When that promise resolves, the dialog is\n   closed.  When the promise is rejected, it's error is displayed in\n   the dialog, and the dialog stays open.\n\n   Fields are described by calling functions such as TextInput.  A\n   number of generic ones are defined here, and you can define more\n   specialized ones yourself.\n\n   They are all called like this:\n\n       FieldFunction(tag, title, { option: value, ... })\n\n   The \"tag\" is used to uniquely identify this field in the dialog.\n   The action function will receive the values of all fields in an\n   object, and the tag of a field is the key in that object, for\n   example.  The tag is also used to interact with a field from tests.\n\n   ACTION FUNCTIONS\n\n   The action funtion is called like this:\n\n      action(values, progress_callback)\n\n   The \"values\" parameter contains the validated values of the dialog\n   fields and the \"progress_callback\" can be called by the action function\n   to update the progress information in the dialog while it runs.\n\n   The progress callback should be called like this:\n\n      progress_callback(message, cancel_callback)\n\n   The \"message\" will be displayed in the dialog and if \"cancel_callback\" is\n   not null, the Cancel button in the dialog will be enabled and\n   \"cancel_callback\" will be called when the user clicks it.\n\n   The return value of the action function is normally a promise.  When\n   it is resolved, the dialog is closed.  When it is rejected the value\n   given in the rejection is displayed as an error in the dialog.\n\n   If the error value is a string, it is displayed as a global failure\n   message.  When it is an object, it contains errors for individual\n   fields in this form:\n\n      { tag1: message, tag2: message }\n\n   As a special case, when \"message\" is \"true\", the field is rendered\n   as having an error (with a red outline, say), but without any\n   directly associated text.  The idea is that a group of fields is in\n   error, and the error message for all of them is shown below the last\n   one in the group.\n\n   COMMON FIELD OPTIONS\n\n   Each field function describes its options.  However, there are some\n   options that apply to all fields:\n\n   - value\n\n   The initial value of the field.\n\n   - visible: vals -> boolean\n\n   This function determines whether the field is shown or not.\n\n   - validate: (val, vals) -> null-or-error-string (or promise)\n\n   The validate function receives the current value of the field and\n   should return \"null\" (or something falsey) when that value is\n   acceptable.  Otherwise, it should return a suitable error message.\n\n   The second argument has all values of all fields, in case you need\n   to look at more than one field.\n\n   The validate function can also return a promise which resolves to\n   null or an error message.  If that promise is rejected, that error\n   is shown globally in the dialog as if the action function had\n   failed.\n\n   The validate function will only be called for currently visible\n   fields.\n\n   - widest_title\n\n   This is a hack to force the column of titles to be a certain\n   minimum width, namely the width of the widest_title.  This matters\n   when there are rows that are only sometimes visible and the layout\n   would jump around when they change visibility.\n\n   Technically, the first column of a row shows the \"title\" but is as\n   wide as its \"widest_title\".  The idea is that you put the widest\n   title of all fields in the widest_title option of one of the rows\n   that are always visible.\n\n   - explanation\n\n   A test to show below the field, as an explanation.\n\n   RUNNING TASKS AND DYNAMIC UPDATES\n\n   The dialog_show function returns an object that can be used to interact\n   with the dialog in various ways while it is open.\n\n       dlg = dialog_show(...)\n\n   One can run asynchronous tasks:\n\n       dlg.run(\"title\", promise)\n\n   This will disable the footer buttons and wait for promise to be resolved\n   or rejected while showing \"title\" and a spinner.\n\n   One can set field values and options:\n\n       dlg.set_values({ tag1: value1, tag2: value2, ... })\n       dlg.set_options(tag, { opt1: value1, opt2: value2, ... })\n\n   It is also possible to specify a \"update\" function when creating the dialog:\n\n       dialog_show({ ...\n                     update: function (dlg, vals, trigger) { }\n                     ... })\n\n   This function is called whenever the values of fields are changed.  The\n   \"trigger\" argument is the tag of the field that has just been changed.\n\n   DEFINING NEW FIELD TYPES\n\n   To define a new field type, just define a new function that follows\n   a few rules.  Here is TextInput:\n\n       export const TextInput = (tag, title, options) => {\n        return {\n            tag: tag,\n            title: title,\n            options: options,\n            initial_value: \"\",\n\n            render: (val, change) =>\n                <input data-field={tag}\n                       className=\"form-control\" type=\"text\" value={val}\n                       onChange={event => change(event.target.value)}/>\n        }\n       }\n\n   As you can see, a field function should return an object with a\n   couple of fields.  The \"tag\", \"title\", and \"options\" field just\n   store the parameters to the field function.  The rest are these:\n\n   - initial_value\n\n   This is the initial value of the field.\n\n   - render: (val, change) -> React components\n\n   This should render the value part of the field, that is, the second\n   column in the table layout.  The title is in the first column and\n   is rendered by the generic dialog machinery.\n\n   The \"val\" parameter is the current value and you should make sure\n   that the DOM element really shows that value, and not something\n   that might have left behind by previous user interactions.\n\n   The \"change\" parameter is a function that should be called with a\n   new value for the field whenever the user has interacted with it.\n\n   For the benefits of the integration tests, the DOM elements should\n   also contain \"data-field\" and maybe a \"data-field-type\" attributes.  The\n   \"data-field\" value should be that tag of the field, and\n   \"data-field-type\" type is used by the tests to know how to interact\n   with the field.  If you find to need it, just pick a reasonable value\n   and extend the test suite to handle it.\n\n   This function is not called at all for invisible fields.\n */\n\nimport cockpit from \"cockpit\";\n\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { OverlayTrigger, Tooltip } from \"patternfly-react\";\n\nimport { show_modal_dialog } from \"cockpit-components-dialog.jsx\";\nimport { StatelessSelect, SelectEntry } from \"cockpit-components-select.jsx\";\nimport { fmt_size, block_name, format_size_and_text } from \"./utils.js\";\n\nimport \"form-layout.less\";\n\nconst _ = cockpit.gettext;\n\nconst Validated = ({ errors, error_key, explanation, children }) => {\n    var error = errors && errors[error_key];\n    var text = error || explanation;\n    // We need to always render the <div> for the has-error\n    // class so that the input field keeps the focus when\n    // errors are cleared.

It will insert 'reboot' markers, for\n   example, and collapse repeated lines.  You can extend the output at\n   the bottom and also at the top.\n\n   A new renderer is created by calling 'journal.renderer' like\n   so:\n\n      var renderer = journal.renderer(funcs);\n\n   You can feed new entries into the renderer by calling various\n   methods on the returned object:\n\n      - renderer.append(journal_entry)\n      - renderer.append_flush()\n      - renderer.prepend(journal_entry)\n      - renderer.prepend_flush()\n\n   A 'journal_entry' is one element of the result array returned by a\n   call to 'Query' with the 'cockpit.journal_fields' as the fields to\n   return.\n\n   Calling 'append' will append the given entry to the end of the\n   output, naturally, and 'prepend' will prepend it to the start.\n\n   The output might lag behind what has been input via 'append' and\n   'prepend', and you need to call 'append_flush' and 'prepend_flush'\n   respectively to ensure that the output is up-to-date.  Flushing a\n   renderer does not introduce discontinuities into the output.  You\n   can continue to feed entries into the renderer after flushing and\n   repeated lines will be correctly collapsed across the flush, for\n   example.\n\n   The renderer will call methods of the 'output_funcs' object to\n   produce the desired output:\n\n      - output_funcs.append(rendered)\n      - output_funcs.remove_last()\n      - output_funcs.prepend(rendered)\n      - output_funcs.remove_first()\n\n   The 'rendered' argument is the return value of one of the rendering\n   functions described below.  The 'append' and 'prepend' methods\n   should add this element to the output, naturally, and 'remove_last'\n   and 'remove_first' should remove the indicated element.\n\n   If you never call 'prepend' on the renderer, 'output_func.prepend'\n   isn't called either.  If you never call 'renderer.prepend' after\n   'renderer.prepend_flush', then 'output_func.remove_first' will\n   never be called.  The same guarantees exist for the 'append' family\n   of functions.\n\n   The actual rendering is also done by calling methods on\n   'output_funcs':\n\n      - output_funcs.render_line(ident, prio, message, count, time, cursor)\n      - output_funcs.render_day_header(day)\n      - output_funcs.render_reboot_separator()\n\n*/\n\njournal.renderer = function renderer(funcs_or_box) {\n    var output_funcs;\n    if (funcs_or_box.render_line)\n        output_funcs = funcs_or_box;\n    else\n        output_funcs = output_funcs_for_box(funcs_or_box);\n\n    function copy_object(o) {\n        var c = { }; for (var p in o) c[p] = o[p]; return c;\n    }\n\n    // A 'entry' object describes a journal entry in formatted form.\n    // It has fields 'bootid', 'ident', 'prio', 'message', 'time',\n    // 'day', all of which are strings.\n\n    function format_entry(journal_entry) {\n        function pad(n) {\n            var str = n.toFixed();\n            if (str.length == 1)\n                str = '0' + str;\n            return str;\n        }\n\n        var d = new Date(journal_entry[\"__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP\"] / 1000);\n        return {\n            cursor: journal_entry[\"__CURSOR\"],\n            full: journal_entry,\n            day: month_names[d.getMonth()] + ' ' + d.getDate().toFixed() + ', ' + d.getFullYear().toFixed(),\n            time: pad(d.getHours()) + ':' + pad(d.getMinutes()),\n            bootid: journal_entry[\"_BOOT_ID\"],\n            ident: journal_entry[\"SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER\"] || journal_entry[\"_COMM\"],\n            prio: journal_entry[\"PRIORITY\"],\n            message: journal.printable(journal_entry[\"MESSAGE\"])\n        };\n    }\n\n    function entry_is_equal(a, b) {\n        return (a && b &&\n                a.day == b.day &&\n                a.bootid == b.bootid &&\n                a.ident == b.ident &&\n                a.prio == b.prio &&\n                a.message == b.message);\n    }\n\n    // A state object describes a line that should be eventually\n    // output.
